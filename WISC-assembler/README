The file assembler.pl is a Perl script that will process assembly code and
generate machine code. To use, create your assembly code program in a
file, e.g. 'infile', then in a Linux terminal, use the command:

   perl assembler.pl <infile> > <outfile> 

If you specify an outfile name, the output will be saved in that file.
If you don't specify an outfile name, the output will be sent to the
screen.

Additional comments (also in assembler.pl):

#NOTES:

# -All labels MUST start with L

# -No label at the beginning address 0000

# -Shift amounts must be in decimal

# -Immediate may be in hex or decimal.  If in hex, precede with "0x"

# -Comments may be specified with either "#" or "//".  

# -No multiline comments

#

#

Of course, you will need to have Perl installed on your machine.
