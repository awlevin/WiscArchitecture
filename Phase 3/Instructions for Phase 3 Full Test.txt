Test that if branch works, especially if it's the first or last instruction of a cache block.
Check that if that memory contention works when I Cache and D Cache miss simultaneously.
Add LRU specific tests. Correct block filled on miss, and updated accordingly on hits

Issue:	Branches before cache misses have their branch decision made while stalling for cache
		fill, then don't branch afterword
		
		
Write through

Eviction

D Cache and I Cache miss overlap

Ensure upstream instructions stalled on D Cache misses, NOPs inserted on I Cache misses
