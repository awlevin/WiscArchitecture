# WiscArchitecture
Class project where we designed a fully functional CPU. The ISA (instruction set architecture) is included in the PDF's/.docx files within each phase. 

## Phase 1
A single cycle CPU

## Phase 2
Another CPU implementation with a 5 stage pipeline, RF Bypassing, and full-forwarding.

## Phase 3
Added a two-way set-associative cache with LRU eviction for memory loads and stores.
